    "describe() method in Pandas is used to generate descriptive statistics of DataFrame columns. It gives a quick summary of key statistical metrics like mean, standard deviation, percentiles, and more. By default, describe() works with numeric data but can also handle categorical data, offering tailored insights based on data type.\n",

    "Parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "percentiles: A list of numbers between 0 and 1, specifying which percentiles to return. The default is None, which returns the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "include: A list of data types to include in the summary. You can specify data types such as int, float, object (for strings), etc. The default is None, meaning all numeric types are included.\n",

    "Understanding Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis method compares two opposite statements about a population and uses sample data to decide which one is more likely to be correct.\n",
    "To test this assumption we first take a sample from the population and analyze it and use the results of the analysis to decide if the claim is valid or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Null hypothesis (H0): The null hypothesis is the starting assumption in statistics. It says there is no relationship between groups.\n",
    "eg.  A company claims its average production is 50 units per day then here:\n",
    "Null Hypothesis: H₀: The mean number of daily production (μ) = 50.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternative hypothesis (H1): The alternative hypothesis is the opposite of the null hypothesis it suggests there is a difference between groups.\n",
    "e.g  The alternative hypothesis is the opposite of the null hypothesis it suggests there is a difference between groups. like The company’s production is not equal to 50 units per day then the alternative hypothesis would be:\n",
    "H₁: The mean number of daily production (μ) ≠ 50.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Terms of Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "1. Level of significance: \n",
    "It refers to the degree of significance in which we accept or reject the null hypothesis.(your output should be 95% confident to give a similar kind of result in each sample.)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. P-value: \n",
    "When analyzing data the p-value tells you the likelihood of seeing your result if the null hypothesis is true. If your P-value is less than the chosen significance level then you reject the null hypothesis otherwise accept it.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Test Statistic: \n",
    "Test statistic is the number that helps you decide whether your result is significant. It’s calculated from the sample data you collect it could be used to test if a machine learning model performs better than a random guess.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Critical value: \n",
    "Critical value is a boundary or threshold that helps you decide if your test statistic is enough to reject the null hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Degrees of freedom: Degrees of freedom are important when we conduct statistical tests they help you understand how much data can vary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Types of Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "1. One-Tailed Test\n",
    "A one-tailed test is used when we expect a change in only one direction—either an increase or a decrease but not both.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s say if we’re analyzing data to see if a new algorithm improves accuracy we would only focus on whether the accuracy goes up not down.\n",
    "\n",
    "The test looks at just one side of the data to decide if the result is enough to reject the null hypothesis. If the data falls in the critical region on that side then we reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of one-tailed test:\n",
    "\n",
    "Left-Tailed (Left-Sided) Test: If the alternative hypothesis say that the true parameter value is less than the null hypothesis. then it is a Left tailed test. Example: H0: μ ≥ 50 and H1: μ < 50\n",
    "Right-Tailed (Right-Sided) Test: when the alternative hypothesis say that the true parameter value is greater than the null hypothesis then it is called Right Tailed test. Example: H0: μ ≤ 50 and H1: μ > 50\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Two-Tailed Test\n",
    "A two-tailed test is used when we want to check for a significant difference in both directions—whether the result is greater than or less than a specific value. We use this test when we don’t have a specific expectation about the direction of change.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we are testing whether a new marketing strategy affects sales we want to know if sales increase or decrease so we look at both possibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: H0: μ = 50 and H1: μ ≠ 50\n",
    "\n",
    "To go deeper into differences into both types of test: Refer to link \n",
    "\"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-one-tailed-and-two-tailed-tests/\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Type I error: When we reject the null hypothesis although that hypothesis was true. Type I error is denoted by alpha(α).(False Negative)\n",
    "\n",
    "Type II errors: When we accept the null hypothesis but it is false. Type II errors are denoted by beta(β).(False Positive)\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Imagine we want to test if a new recommendation algorithm increases user engagement.\n",
    "1. Definition:\n",
    "(H₀): The new algorithm has no effect on user engagement.\n",
    "(H₁): The new algorithm increases user engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. choose a significance level (α):\n",
    "commonly set at 0.05. This level defines the threshold for deciding if the results are statistically significant.\n",
    "It also tells us the probability of making a Type I error—rejecting a true null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Collect and Analyze data.\n",
    "we gather data this could come from user observations or an experiment.\n",
    "Once collected we analyze the data using appropriate statistical methods to calculate the test statistic.\n",
    "Example: We collect data on user engagement before and after implementing the algorithm. We can also find the mean engagement scores for each group.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Calculate Test Statistic\n",
    "The test statistic is a measure used to determine if the sample data support in reject the null hypothesis. The choice of the test statistic depends on the type of hypothesis test being conducted it could be a Z-test, Chi-square, T-test and so on. For our example we are dealing with a t-test because:\n",
    "We have a smaller sample size.\n",
    "The population standard deviation is unknown.\n",
    "T-statistic is a measure of the difference between the means of two groups relative to the variability within each group. It is calculated as the difference between the sample means divided by the standard error of the difference. It is also known as the t-value or t-score.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Comparing Test Statistic\n",
    "Now we compare the test statistic to either the critical value or the p-value to decide whether to reject the null hypothesis or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Method A: \n",
    "Using Critical values: \n",
    "We refer to a statistical distribution table like the t-distribution in this case to find the critical value based on the chosen significance level (α).\n",
    "\n",
    "If Test Statistic > Critical Value then we Reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "If Test Statistic ≤ Critical Value then we fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "Example: If the p-value is 0.03 and α is 0.05 then we reject the null hypothesis because the p-value is smaller than the significance level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Critical values are predetermined threshold values that are used to make a decision in hypothesis testing. To determine critical values for hypothesis testing, we typically refer to a statistical distribution table such as the normal distribution or t-distribution tables based on.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Method B:\n",
    "Using P-values:\n",
    "We can also come to an conclusion using the p-value\n",
    "If the p-value ≤ significance level (p ≤ α) then you reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "If the p-value ≥ significance level (p ≥ α) then you fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "Note: To determine p-value for hypothesis testing we typically refer to a statistical distribution table such as the normal distribution or t-distribution tables based on.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "6. Interpret the Results\n",
    "Based on the comparison of the test statistic to the critical value or p-value we can conclude whether there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Z-statistics:\n",
    "It is used when population means and standard deviations are known. The formula of z-statistics is given by:\n",
    "    z = x̄ - μ  /  σ/√n\n",
    "\n",
    "where\n",
    "x̄ is the sample mean,\n",
    "μ represents the population mean, \n",
    "σ is the standard deviation\n",
    "and n is the size of the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. T-Statistics\n",
    "T-test is used to compare the means of two datasets (e.g., experimental vs. control groups) to assess if the difference is statistically significant. It is used when n<30 t-statistic calculation is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "t = x̄ - μ / s/√n\n",
    "\n",
    "where\n",
    "t = t-score,\n",
    "x̄ = sample mean\n",
    "μ = population mean,\n",
    "s = standard deviation of the sample,\n",
    "n = sample size\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Chi-Square Test\n",
    "Chi-Square Test compares the observed frequency distribution of data to the expected distribution to see if the differences are just random or meaningful using:\n",
    "χ2 = ∑ (Oij - Eij)2 / Eij\n",
    "where:\n",
    "Oij is the observed frequency in cell \n",
    "i,j are the rows and columns index respectively.\n",
    "Eij is the expected frequency in cell ij, calculated as : \n",
    "    Row total × Column total / Total observations\n",
    "\n",
    "Real life Examples of Hypothesis Testing:\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a pharmaceutical company has developed a new drug that they believe can effectively lower blood pressure in patients with hypertension. Before bringing the drug to market they need to conduct a study to see its impact on blood pressure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data:\n",
