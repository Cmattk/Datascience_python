    "Feature selection is the process of identifying and selecting a subset of relevant features for use in model construction. The goal is to enhance the model's performance by reducing overfitting, improving accuracy, and reducing training time.\n",

    "Improved Model Performance: \n",
    "By removing irrelevant or redundant features, we can improve the accuracy of the model.\n",
    "Reduced Overfitting: \n",
    "With fewer features, the model is less likely to learn noise from the training data.\n",

    "Types of Feature Selection Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Filter Methods: Filter methods use statistical techniques to evaluate the relevance of features independently of the model. Common techniques include correlation coefficients, chi-square tests, and mutual information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wrapper Methods: Wrapper methods use a predictive model to evaluate feature subsets and select the best-performing combination. Techniques include recursive feature elimination (RFE) and forward/backward feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Embedded Methods: Embedded methods perform feature selection during the model training process. Examples include Lasso (L1 regularization) and feature importance from tree-based models.\n",

    "Feature Selection Techniques with Scikit-Learn\n",
    "Scikit-Learn provides several tools for feature selection, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "Univariate Selection: Univariate selection evaluates each feature individually to determine its importance. Techniques like 'SelectKBest' and 'SelectPercentile' can be used to select the top features based on statistical tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE): RFE is a wrapper method that recursively removes the least important features based on a model's performance. It repeatedly builds a model and eliminates the weakest features until the desired number of features is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Importance from Tree-based Models: Tree-based models like 'decision trees' and 'random forests' can provide feature importance scores, indicating the importance of each feature in making predictions.\n"
